# green_heaven_online_market
This is my fourth milestone project with Code Institute and Runshaw College. I used Django for this project.
# 1. Purpose of the project
The aim of this project is to develop an online garden center for an imaginary company, enabling them to effectively sell gardening products, plants, and seeds. This platform will enhance their marketing reach, providing a convenient 24/7 online presence and allowing customers to browse and shop from the comfort of their homes. The project seeks to streamline the shopping experience by offering easy navigation, personalized account features, and seamless checkout. Additionally, it will empower customers to discover new products, while helping the company attract a broader audience and increase sales.
# 2. User stories
- As a user, I would like to see the nav bar on every pages, and any screen sizes, and easily navigate between pages.
- As a user I can create a new account and I can see the features for signed up users.
- As a user I can sign in so I can use functionality for logged in users.
- As a user I can sign out so my user experience is not going to get compromised.
- As a user I can see sign in / sign up / log out options, so I can use this function.
- As a user I can update my profile.
- As a user I can purchase items from the website, check my shopping history.
- As a user I can search for items on the website.
- As an admin I can add items to the website to sell.
- As an admin I want to help users to sort out their problems with their profile/order.
